    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding  heat transport in semiconductors and insulators is of fundamental importance because of its  technological impact in electronics and renewable energy harvesting and conversion.\n",
    "Anharmonic Lattice Dynamics provides a powerful framework for the description of heat transport at the nanoscale. One of the advantages of this method is that it naturally includes quantum effects due to atoms vibrations, which are needed to compute thermal properties of semiconductors widely use in nanotechnology, like Silicon and Carbon, even at room temperature.\n",
    "While heat transport in amorphous and crystalline semiconductors has a  different microscopic origin, a unified approach to simulate both crystals and glasses has been devised.\n",
    "Here we introduce a unified workflow, which implements both the Boltzmann Transport equation (BTE) and the Quasi Harmonic Green-Kubo (QHGK) methods. We discuss how the theory can be optimized to exploit modern parallel architectures, and how it is implemented in kALDo:  a versatile and scalable open-source software to compute phonon transport in solids.\n",

    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In semiconductors, electronic and vibrational dynamics often occur over different time scales, and can thus be decoupled using the Born Oppenheimer approximation. Under this assumption, the potential $\\phi$ of a system made of $N_{atoms}$ atoms, is a function of all the $x_{i\\alpha}$ atomic positions, where $i$ and $\\alpha$ refer to the atomic and Cartesian indices, respectively. Near thermal equilibrium, the potential energy can be Taylor expanded in the atomic displacements, $\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf x-\\mathbf{x}_{\\rm equilibrium}$,\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The IFCs  can be evaluated by finite difference, which consists in calculating the difference between the forces acting on the system when one of the atoms is displaced by a small finite shift along a Cartesian direction. The second and third order IFCs need respectively, $2N_{atoms}$, and $4N_{atoms}^2$ forces calculations. In crystals, this amount can be reduced exploiting the spatial symmetries of the system, or adopting a compressed sensing approach. In the framework of DFT, it is also possible and often convenient to compute IFCs using perturbation theory.\n",

    "The dynamical matrix is the second order IFC rescaled by the masses, $D_{i\\alpha i'\\alpha}=\\phi^{\\prime\\prime}_{i\\alpha i'\\alpha'}/\\sqrt{m_im_{i'}}$. It is diagonal in the phonons basis\n",

    "Classical and quantum properties for 4096 atom amorphous silicon system are shown above. a) density of states, b) lifetimes, c) diffusivities, and e) cumulative thermal conductivity. In spite of the increased quantum lifetimes, a decrease of 0.17W/m/K is seen in the quantum conductivity. The difference in conductivity is primarily a result of the overestimation of classical high frequency heat capacities.\n",
