    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forcefields.** Using the [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/), kALDo can calculate the interatomic force constants using several ab-initio and molecular dynamics codes. A native [LAMMPS](https://github.com/lammps/lammps) interface is also available in the USER-PHONON package. Through seamless integration with the [HiPhive](https://hiphive.materialsmodeling.org/) package, the IFC calculation can take advantage of compressing-sensing machine learning algorithms. Version 2.0 adds native support for modern MLPs including [NEP](https://github.com/brucefan1983/GPUMD), [MACE](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace), [MatterSim](https://github.com/microsoft/mattersim), and [Orb](https://github.com/orbital-materials/orb-models).\n",
    "\n",
    "**CPUs and GPUs.** Multithread implementation on CPUs and GPUs. The algorithms are implemented using linear algebra operations on tensors, to take advantage of multithreading on GPU and CPU using Numpy, Tensorflow and optimized tensor libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalable.** In a system of N atoms and N_k k points, kALDo uses (3N)² floating point numbers to save the state of the system when using QHGK, (N_k × 3N)² for the full solution of the BTE and N_k × 3N² when using BTE-RTA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance.** The bottleneck in ALD simulations is the calculation of phonon lifetimes and scattering matrices. This step requires projecting the interatomic potential on 3N phonon modes and scales like (N_k × 3N)³. In kALDo this is implemented as tensor multiplications, with GPU acceleration providing 5-10× speedup for systems with >50 atoms.\n",

    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermal transport calculations in kALDo proceed through three main stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 1: Force Constant Generation.** Second and third-order interatomic force constants (IFCs) are computed or imported. These tensors encode harmonic and anharmonic interatomic interactions. Methods include: (i) finite-difference calculations with user-specified atomic displacements, (ii) direct import from density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations, (iii) extraction from molecular dynamics trajectories via [TDEP](https://github.com/tdep-developers/tdep), or (iv) loading from external codes in various file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 2: Phonon Property Computation.** The dynamical matrix constructed from second-order IFCs is diagonalized to obtain phonon frequencies, eigenvectors, and group velocities. Third-order IFCs are projected onto phonon eigenstates to compute scattering phase space and rates. Additional properties including heat capacities, populations (Bose-Einstein or classical), and optional isotopic scattering rates are calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 3: Thermal Conductivity Calculation.** The BTE or QHGK formalism is employed using phonon properties from Stage 2. Multiple solution methods are available depending on accuracy requirements, memory constraints, and material characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interatomic Force Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate thermal transport predictions require precise determination of interatomic force constants (IFCs), which describe the potential energy surface governing atomic motion.
