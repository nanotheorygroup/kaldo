Example 4_silicon_clathrate_Tersoff_LAMMPS illustrates how to perform thermal 
transport simulation for a type I clathrate (46 atoms per cell) system using LAMMPS 
USER-PHONON package as force calculator.

The forceconstant calculation proceeds as follows:
			in.Si46:
			1-1).  Compute 2nd, 3rd interatomic force constants with LAMMPS USER-PHONON
			
			or

			get_precalculated_fc.sh:
			2-1).  Download precalculated forceconstants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON


The phonon calculation proceeds as follows:
			 1_Si46_Tersoff_harmonic_properties.py:	
		         1-1). Set up force constant object by loading in computed 2nd, 3rd interatomic force constants with LAMMPS.

		         1-2). Set up phonon object (3x3x3 k-point mesh) and perform quantum simulation at 300K and compute
			      harmonic properties (dispersion relation, group velocity , density of states and heat capacity).


		        2_Si46_Tersoff_thermal_conductivity.py:
		        2-1). Set up force constant object by loading in computed 2nd, 3rd interatomic force constants with LAMMPS.

		        2-2). Set up phonon object (3x3x3 k-point mesh) and perform quantum simulation at 300K.

			2-3). Set up Conductivity obejct and compute thermal conductivity by solving Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) 
				with Relaxation Time Approximation (RTA).

			3_Si46_Tersoff_visualize_anharmonic_properties.py:
			3-1). Compute and visualize phase spaces and life times from RTA.
