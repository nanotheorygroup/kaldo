Example 2_amorphous_silicon_Tersoff_LAMMPS illustrates how to perform thermal 
transport simulation for amorphous silicon samples (512 atoms system) with
LAMMPS USER-PHONON package as force calculator.

External files required: 
		       1) forcefields/Si.tersoff


The forceconstant calculation proceeds as follows:
			in.aSi512:
			1-1).  Compute 2nd, 3rd interatomic force constants with LAMMPS USER-PHONON
			
			or
			get_precalculated_fc.sh:
			2-1).  Download precalculated forceconstants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON


The phonon calculation proceeds as follows:

		        1_aSi512_Tersoff_thermal_conductivity.py:
		        1-1). Set up force constant object by loading in computed 2nd, 3rd interatomic force constants with LAMMPS.

		        1-2). Set up phonon object and perform quantum simulation at 300K.

			1-3). Set up Conductivity obejct and compute thermal conductivity by solving Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) with Quasi
			           Harmonic Green Kubo (QHGK) method.
	
			1-4). Set up Conductivity obejct and compute diffusivity with Quasi Harmonic Green Kubo (QHGK) method.
