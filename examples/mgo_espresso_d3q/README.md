# Setup
Please use the "unpack.sh" bash script to unpack the force constants

# Running
Execute the python scripts in order to generate the harmonic quantities,
then plot them!
    >> This generates a plot to compare velocities and frequencies along
    >> the chosen path.

Execute the anharmonic script to output the thermal conductivity in
both RTA and full inversion for both the NAC and uncorrected forces.
