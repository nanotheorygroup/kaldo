# Setup
Please untar and unzip the data/mgo-qe-d3q.tgz file.
Then, copy the POSCAR and FORCE_CONSTANTS_THIRD file from the forces directory to the 
forces_no_charges directory.

# Running
Execute 1_run_simulation.py to calculate both corrected and uncorrected quantities.

# Plotting
Plots are generated by the 1_run_simulation.py script, but to compare the system
side-by-side with NAC corrections, you may use 2_plot_comparisons.py

# Reference Plots
Copies of the plots that should be output by the scripts are available in the data/reference_plots.tgz
archive if you'd like to check your example came out correctly.
