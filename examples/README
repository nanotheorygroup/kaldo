These collections of examples show how to perform thermal transport with kALDo for cystall and amorphous
systems. Before running simulations with kALDo, some prerequired simulation tools are listed as follow:

					Quantum ESPRESSO (https://www.quantum-espresso.org/)
				        LAMMPS (https://lammps.sandia.gov/download.html)
					hiPhive (https://hiphive.materialsmodeling.org/)


To enable calculations of the 2nd and 3rd order force constants with LAMMPS in ASE, please run the following lines in the command window:

					cd path/to/lammps/src
					make yes-manybody
					make yes-molecule
					make mpi mode=shlib

After properly installed kALDo, run the following liine in command window to link LAMMPS with Python and ASE:

					make install-python
				

To enable calculations of the 2nd and 3rd order force constants with Quantum ESPRESSO in ASE, please run the following lines in the command window:
				

					export ASE_ESPRESSO_COMMAND="mpirun -np 8 /path/to/pw.x -in PREFIX.pwi > PREFIX.pwo"



In examples 2 and 4, the 2nd and 3rd order force constants are computed by using LAMMPS USER-PHONON packages. Since these material systems have 
relatively large  unit cell, computing force constants using the USER-PHONON package currently available in the official website can take hours. 
To speed up the calculation, one can download and compile LAMMPS with optimized force constants calculation functionality from the following repo: 


					https://github.com/charlessievers/lammps/tree/OptimizedDynamicalMatrix. 
 

To obtain precalculated force constants for each example, please run the following lines in the command window:

					chmod +x get_precalculated_fc.sh
					./get_precalculated.sh


To obtain reference calculations of phonon properties and plots for each example, please run the following lines in the command window:

					chmod +x get_reference.sh
					./get_reference.sh
